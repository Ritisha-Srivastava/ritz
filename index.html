    <h1 style="background-color:rebeccapurple;"><center><b>Indian Classical Dance Forms</b></center></h1>
    <p><pre>Dance is a performing art form consisting of purposefully selected sequences of human movement. 
This movement has aesthetic and symbolic value, and is acknowledged as dance by performers and observers
within a particular culture.Dance can be categorized and described by its choreography, by its repertoire
of movements, or by its historical period or place of origin.

An important distinction is to be drawn between the contexts of theatrical and participatory dance,although
these two categories are not always completely separate; both may have special functions, whether social, 
ceremonial, competitive, erotic, martial, or sacred/liturgical. Other forms of human movement are sometimes
said to have a dance-like quality, including martial arts, gymnastics, cheerleading, figure skating, 
synchronised swimming, marching bands, and many other forms of athletics.</pre></p>

            dance forms.The roots of Manipuri dance, as with all classical Indian dances, is
            the ancient Hindu Sanskrit text Natya Shastra, with influences and the culture fusion
            between various local folk dance forms.According to the traditional legend, the

<h3><b>3.<u> Kuchipudi</u>:<br></b></h3>
<pre><p>            Kuchipudi is one of the major Indian classical dances.Kuchipudi is a dance-drama 
            performance, with its roots in the ancient Hindu Sanskrit text of Natya Shastra.It developed 
            as a religious art linked to traveling bards, temples and spiritual beliefs, like all major 
            classical dances of India. Evidence of Kuchipudi's existence in an older version are found 
            in copper inscriptions of the 10th century, and by the 15th century in texts such as the 
            Machupalli Kaifat.Kuchipudi tradition holds that Tirtha Narayana Yati – a sanyassin of Advaita 
            Vedanta persuasion,and his disciple, an orphan named Siddhendra Yogi, founded and systematized 
            the modern version of Kuchipudi in the 17th century.Kuchipudi largely developed as a Hindu god 
            Krishna-oriented Vaishnavism tradition,and it is most closely related to Bhagavata Mela.

<h3><b>4.<u> Kathak</u>:<br></b></h3>
<pre><p>            The term Kathak is derived from the Vedic Sanskrit word Katha which means "story", and 
            Kathakar which means "the one who tells a story", or "to do with stories".Wandering Kathakars 
            communicated stories from the great epics and ancient mythology through dance, songs and music.
            Kathak dancers tell various stories through their hand movements and extensive footwork, but most 
            importantly through their facial expressions. Kathak evolved during the Bhakti movement, particularly
            by incorporating the childhood and stories of the Hindu god Krishna, as well as independently in the
            courts of north Indian kingdoms.Kathak is unique in having both Hindu and Muslim gharanas and
            cultural elements.Kathak performances include Urdu Ghazals and commonly use instruments brought 
            during Muslim rule.

            northern India known as Kathakars or storytellers.Kathak is found in three distinct forms, called "gharanas", 
            named after the cities where the Kathak dance tradition evolved – Jaipur, Banaras and Lucknow.

<h3><b>5.<u> Odissi</u>:<br></b></h3>

            musicians play out a mythical story, a spiritual message or devotional poem from the Hindu texts, 
            using symbolic costumes,body movement, abhinaya (expressions) and mudras (gestures and sign language) 
            set out in ancient Sanskrit literature.Classical Odia literature & the Gitagovinda set to traditional 
            Odissi music are used for the abhinaya. Odissi is learnt and performed as a composite of basic dance 
            motif called the Bhangas (symmetric body bends, stance). It involves lower (footwork), mid (torso) and 
            upper (hand and head) as three sources of perfecting expression and audience engagement with geometric 
            symmetry and rhythmic musical resonance.An Odissi performance repertoire includes invocation, nritta 
            (pure dance), nritya (expressive dance), natya (dance drama) and moksha (dance climax connoting freedom 
            of the soul and spiritual release)
